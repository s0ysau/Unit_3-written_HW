In the App.js First, importing useState from react and will allow only a certain part of the page update while leaving the rest of the page the same. 

Next, the function MyButton() will create the functionality of the page by first establishing two parameters [count, setCount] and setting equal to useState(0). This will set the count to start at 0. 

Then, within the MyButton(), a component function handleClick(), will call setCount() and pass the new value to it. In this case, setCount() is set to (count + 1).

Then, the MyButton() function will return a button tag with a event handler for a click to trigger the handleclick function and a text that indicate the number of times the button is clicked.  

Finally, export default returns an HTML format that displays a heading and two MyButton components, calling the MyButton function twice.

In the index.html, the div tag with id=root will go to index.js and render App.js via 

```
import App from "./App";
<App />

```
