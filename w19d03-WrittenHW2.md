What is a Single Page Application? </br>
An Single Page Application (SPA) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a 
web browser loading entire new pages.


What is REACT? </br>
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. React can be used as a base in the development of 
single page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks by building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.


What is JSX? </br>
JSX, which means JavaScript XML, allows developers to write HTML in React which makes it easier to write and add HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.


What is Babel? </br>
Babel is a transpiler that converts the latest version of JavaScript code into the one that the browser understands especially since the latest standard version of JavaScript isn't fully supported by all web browsers thus converting it the code into code the browser can understand.


What is Webpack? </br>
Webpack is a free and open-source static module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, it transforms front-end assests such as HTML, CSS, and images into valid modules if the corresponding loaders are included. 


What is Create React App? </br>
Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. Create React App doesn't handle backend logic or databases; it just creates frontend build pipelines, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, unbeknowst to the user.
